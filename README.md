# BLÃ˜GGN theme
The Ghost theme for my blog at blog.chenghiz.net. I can never settle on a color scheme for my personal sites, so this one just changes all the time automatically. At night, the color scheme will flip from black on white to white on black, to go easy on your eyes. Hope you like it!

Title font is Sweden Sans; body text is set in Crimson Text from Google webfonts.
